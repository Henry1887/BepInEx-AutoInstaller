This is a Tool that automatically installs the correct BepInEx version onto ur Unity Game with some optional plugins.

main.py has been converted to main.exe with auto-py-to-exe

# How to use it

1. Move the main.exe or main.py file into the same folder as the game (Where the Games Executable is located, theres a "{Game Name}.exe" file and a "{Game Name}_Data" folder in the Games Directory)
2. Execute the main.exe or open a command prompt in the same folder and type "python main.py" and follow the on screen instructions.
